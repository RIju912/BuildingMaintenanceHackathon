## What problem we tried to solve.

•DIY support for Installer and Maintenance Technicians
•Real time report of the current state of the equipment 
•Minimizing the error rate of misconfigurations
•Minimizing the dependency on the OEM help. 


## How do we solve

1. Verification of the installed component with reference data of the OEM
2. Verification process report the status of the configured attributes (qualified/not qualified)
3. For “not qualified” the CHATBOT option is provided as DIY support. 
4. CHATBOT will assist with suggested solutions
5. CHATBOT will provide the options of installation video links and the installation guides.
6. AR will provide the direction to the installer to reach to the not qualified equipment from his current location.
